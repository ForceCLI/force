### login
When you login using the CLI a record of the login is saved. Eventually your token will expire requiring re-authentication. The default login is for all production instances of salesforce.com. Two predefined non-production instances are available using the test and pre aliases.  You can set an arbitrary instance to log in to by specifying the instance url in the form of subdomain.domain. For example login-blitz.soma.salesforce.com.

      force login     		 	# log in to production or developer org
      force login -i=test 		 	# log in to sandbox org
      force login -i=pre  		 	# log in to prerelease org
      force login -u=un -p=pw 	 	# log in using SOAP
      force login -i=test -u=un -p=pw     	# log in using SOAP to sandbox org
      force login -i=<instance> -u=un -p=pw 	# internal only

### logout
Logout will delete your authentication token and remove the saved record of that login.

      force logout -u=user@example.org

### logins
Logins will list all the user names that you have used to authenticate with the instance URL associated with each one.  The active login will be indicated behind the login name in red.

### active
Active without any arguments will display the currently acctive login that you are using. You can also supply a username argument that will set the active login to the one corresponding to the username argument. Note, just because you set a login as active, does not mean that the token is necessarily valid.

      force active
      force active dave@demo.1
      
### whoami
Whoami will display detailed user information about the currently active logged in user.  This is Force.com specific information.

      force whomai

### sobject
Sobject command gives you access to creating and deleting schema objects. The list argumenet will list ALL of the objects, both standard and custom, in your org.

      force sobject list
      force sobject create <object> [<field>:<type>]...
      force sobject delete <object>

### field
Field gives you the ability to create, list and delete the fields on an object. Fields need to be created one at a time. You can also set required and optional attributes for the type of field. All defaultable field attributes will be defaulted based on the defaults in the web UI.

      force field list Todo__c
      force field create Todo__c Due:DateTime required:true
      force field delete Todo__c Due
